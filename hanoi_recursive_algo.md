The Towers of Hanoi is an intriguing problem and a classic case of the implementation of recursive algorithms.

It involves moving discs between three towers, say A, B and C, and could be so simple as moving one disc or three or five (you get it), with only these rules;
1. Only one disc can be moved at a time.
2. The topmost disc of any tower is the only one available for moving.
3. A wider disc can never be on top a narrower disc.

Interesting constraints, and it gets progessively harder as the number of discs increases.

Now, it's important to take a moment to think about the problem. It obviously involves repeated steps, hence a recursive approach to cracking it.

Here's a visual:

    A       B       C
    -       -       -
    -       -       -
    1       -       -
    2       -       -
    3       -       -
--------------------------

So, with the least number of discs, that could also show the essence of this problem, there's 1, 2, 3 discs - smallest to largest - on tower A, which should move to tower C, and a temporary tower B.

Following the rules;
1. 1 at A moves to C
2. 2 at A can take B
3. Stack up 1 on 2 at B
4. And then, the largest disc, 3, left at A, is free to move on to C

The same process can be repeated to move the discs 1 and 2 at B to C, the destination tower;

5. 1 at B can move to A
6. 2 at B stacks up on 3 at C
7. Then, the smallest disc, 1, is all that's left to move on to C, completing the problem.

This approach is corroborated by these simple steps to recursive problem-solving; making it exponentially easier.

Let f(n) be a recursive function;
1. Take f(n) works called on the input 1; often referred to as the _base case_
2. _Assume_ f called on the input (n - 1) works; n being any number of discs
3. Show f(n) works using f(n - 1)

With this, there's the simple _base_ case of moving one disc and the recursive case of moving more than one disc between the towers.
We could also represent this recursive case in three(3) steps;
1. Move the upper (n - 1) discs from tower A to B (the temporary tower), using tower C as the in-between.
2. Move the single lowest, which is also the largest, disc from tower A to C.
3. Move the (n - 1) discs from tower B to C, using tower A as the in-between.

All these steps are equally necessary. You want to get the base case right, and then make sure the other cases work too.

Writing that simply, with an algorithmic function hanoi, where start, end and other could be substituted for towers A, C and B respectively:

~~~
hanoi(n, start, end) := {
    # pm - print move

    pm(start, end)  if n = 1    # a case of one disc
    other = 6 - (start + end)   # representing the temporary tower if start is 1 and end is 3
    hanoi(n - 1, start, other)  # moving the upper (n - 1) discs from A to B
        pm(start, end)          # the base case n
    hanoi(n - 1, other, end)    # finish up by moving the (n - 1) discs from B to C
}
~~~

So, those are clearer steps which helps implementing simply, with Python.

[//]: # 'Writing code in markdown' 

```
# A recursive algorithm to move the discs in Python

# A function hanoi
def hanoi(begin: Stack[int], end: Stack[int], temp: Stack[int], n: int) -> None:
    if n == 1:
        end.push(begin.pop())
    else:
        hanoi(begin, temp, end, n -1)
        hanoi(begin, end, temp, 1)
        hanoi(temp, end, begin, n - 1)
```

In this piece of code, the parameters for the the function hanoi are the towers represented as Stacks, filling in value of the discs as integers. 

There's a conditional to check the number of discs, solving for either one disc or a couple more; and the methods, push (which just moves a discs) and pop (which removes a disc) are the ways to move the discs around.

The code is intuitive and gets to the heart of the problem, solving for simple and complex cases because of the algorithm already outlined. 

So, the Towers of Hanoi present a fair challenge but not one that can't be tackled with a good grasp of recursive problem solving, and just thinking it through.
