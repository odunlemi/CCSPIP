    "There's often a need to trade these off against other concerns; like Algo A may be faster than algo B but takes up more memory and less elegant than algo C, where elegance is considered a priority. So, the correct answer is \"it depends\".\n",

    "Beyond this, the exact time and space used by a program depends on a host of other factors like;\n",

    "3. How many cores are in use\n",
    "4. How the OS chooses to operate and schedule processes, etc.\n",
